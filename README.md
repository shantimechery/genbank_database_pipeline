# genbank_database_pipeline

The GenBank DataBase Pipeline has two purposes: to map source site data
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's GenBank Database
to their preferred name according to the the National Institute of Health's
United Medical Language System and to create a matrix of bacteria species
and host species data, both also from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information's GenBank Database, pertaining to a specic source site. The rst
part is the Upstream Process and the second part is the Downstream Process.
This matrix created in the Downstream Process will be a part of a NEXUS le,
which can be used as input for PAUP*, a phylogenetic analysis software that
creates phlyogentic trees.
